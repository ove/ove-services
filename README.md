# Open Visualisation Environment - Services

This repository contains a collection of microservices designed to support an [Open Visualisation Environment (OVE)](https://github.com/ove/ove) installation.

OVE is an open-source software stack, designed to be used in large high resolution display (LHRD) environments like the [Imperial College](http://www.imperial.ac.uk) [Data Science Institute's](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/) [Data Observatory](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/data-observatory/).

We welcome collaboration under our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ove/ove-services/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

OVE needs to be installed before using OVE Services. The [OVE Documentation](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides [installation instructions](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/INSTALLATION.html) and a [user guide](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/USAGE.html).

This repository contains the following OVE Services:

* [Persistence (In-Memory)](packages/ove-service-persistence-inmemory/README.md) - Provides in-memory persistence for the OVE framework.
