# Open Visualisation Environment - Services

[Open Visualisation Environment (OVE)](https://github.com/ove/ove) is implemented based on a microservices architecture. All non-core functionality are implemented as a separate set of microservices, collectively known as OVE Services:

* [Persistence (In-Memory)](packages/ove-service-persistence-inmemory/README.md) - Provides in-memory persistence for the OVE framework.

OVE needs to be installed before using OVE Services. The [OVE Documentation](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides [installation instructions](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/INSTALLATION.html) and a [user guide](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/USAGE.html).
